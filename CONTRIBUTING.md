We use **GitHub** to host code, track issues and feature requests, and accept pull requests.

### Submitting Changes

All contributions happen through pull requests:

2. Create a feature branch from `main`.
3. If you've added code that should be tested, add appropriate tests.
4. Ensure the test suite passes locally.
5. Submit your pull request!

We actively welcome your pull requests and will review them as quickly as possible.
